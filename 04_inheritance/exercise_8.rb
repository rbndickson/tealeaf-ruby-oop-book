# 8. Given the following code...

bob = Person.new
bob.hi

#    And the corresponding error message...

#    NoMethodError: private method `hi' called for #<Person:0x007ff61dbb79f0>
#    from (irb):8
#    from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

#    What is the problem and how would you go about fixing it?

The problem is that hi is a private method, so move hi to above the private
section of the class.
